ðŸš€ Exciting Update! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the successful completion of a comprehensive project leveraging Terraform and AWS! ðŸŽ‰

In this endeavor, I:

    Engineered a robust AWS infrastructure from scratch, adhering to best practices for security and scalability.
    Designed and configured a VPC with a public subnet, optimized for high availability and performance.
    Implemented security groups to control access to critical ports (80 for HTTP and 8000 for application-specific traffic).
    Automated Docker container deployments using Docker Compose, streamlining the setup process with custom scripts.
    Managed EC2 instances for hosting applications, ensuring performance and reliability.
    Utilized S3 for Terraform state management, ensuring secure, centralized state files and enhancing team collaboration.

Key Highlights:

    Terraform Provisioners:
        file Provisioner: Seamlessly uploaded Docker Compose and setup scripts to instances, automating environment preparation.
        remote-exec Provisioner: Executed remote commands to install Docker and Docker Compose, automating software setup.
        local-exec Provisioner: Facilitated local operations like saving instance IP addresses to a file for efficient tracking.

    Centralized State Management: Configured the backend to use an S3 bucket for managing Terraform state files, ensuring consistency and security.

This project has significantly deepened my expertise in AWS, Terraform, Docker, and DevOps practices. Iâ€™m excited about future opportunities and eager to tackle new challenges! ðŸ’ª
